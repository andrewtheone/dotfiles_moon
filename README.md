# Dotfiles - Moon Setup (v2)
Setup based on i3wm

This is the 2nd iteration of my beloved configuration on my Ubuntu/i3wm 18.04 minimal install (no matter how many setups I change I keep coming back on this one). Most of this is reworked files of other people, customized to suit my needs and help me build a light-weight system. v2 is the most improved one I made so far.

PS: This is optimal for my small laptop (1280x800) but I'm not sure it will look that good in higher resolutions :)

### Setup:
* i3wm
* polybar
* rofi
* fff
* urxvt (with neofetch)
* ncmpcpp
* cava
* oblogout
* dunst
* compton
