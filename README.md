# Dotfiles - Moon Setup
Setup based on i3wm

This is the configuration of my Ubuntu/i3wm 18.04 minimal installation. Most of this is reworked files of other people, modded to suit my needs and help me build a light-weight system.

PS: This is optimal for my small laptop (1280x800) but I'm not sure it will look that good in higher resolutions :)

### Setup:
* i3wm
* polybar
* rofi
* ranger
* urxvt (with neofetch)
* ncmpcpp
* cava
* oblogout
* dunst
* compton
